# Technology Assessment

## Problem Statement:

You need to build a small app to fetch the weather forecast of multiple cities.
The app may show results in case of no internet based on cached previous fetch results
based on date.

* API Link:
     * [Current City](https://openweathermap.org/current).
     * [Cities forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5).
    
## Note:

* You can use the following api key to authenticate your requests : c***********************3b8f3
* Follow this [documentation](https://openweathermap.org).

## Deliverables:

Developed code should be pushed to GitHub with a clear ReadMe.md explaining how to
build and run the code.
What we care about:

• Object oriented programming approach
• Clean UI
• Good UI approach e.g. MVC/MVVM approach, etc.
• Unit test and Code coverage
• Code to be generic and simple
• leverage today's best coding practices
• Clear README.md that explains how the code and the test can be run and how the
coverage reports can be generated

Create a GitHub repository, ensure the name is generic and doesn’t have any company
names.
Commit your code to the GitHub repository and share the link with us.
Only share a link, do not send the actual code

## Follow up Discussion:
After completing the exercise please be ready for 30 minutes’ discussion on your key
decisions, assumptions and rationale for your implementation.
